# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
This project is a real-time Driver Drowsiness Detection System developed using Python, OpenCV, Dlib, and optionally integrated with Arduino for alert mechanisms. It monitors eye blinks and behavior to detect whether a driver is sleeping, drowsy, or active, and can trigger physical alerts like a buzzer via Arduino.
